                    Step defines a step in a KueryFlow.
                    A step is a tool-call to be executed by Kuery.
                    A tool-call specification includes a function name and a list of arguments
                    to pass. The arguments typically include concrete values, or may be listed
                    as requiring recalculation upon execution.

                        functionCall is the function call to be executed.
                        A functionCall consists of the name of the function to be executed,
                        and the parameters to be passed to the function. A parameter may be
                        a concrete value or present in the argsToRecalculate list.
