                        and the parameters to be passed to the function. A parameter may be
                        a concrete value or "RECALCULATE" to indicate that the value should
                        be recalculated by the Kuery.

                        type is the type of the step.
                        A step can be of types:
                        - human: a step that requires human intervention. Typically, this
                        means that the step is a manual step that requires a human to
                        input a message to Kuery.
                        When type is `human`, the contextForHuman field should be set.

                        - ai: a step that is executed by an AI model. This is a step that
                        is executed by an AI model, and the result is returned to Kuery.
                        When type is `ai`, the aiPrompt field MUST be set.

                        - tool: a step that is executed by a tool. This is a step that
                        results in a function call to a tool. When type is `tool`, the
                        functionCall field MUST be set.
                      enum:
                      - human
